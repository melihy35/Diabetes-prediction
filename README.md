# Diabetes Prediction Project


## Introduction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health-related features. Early detection of diabetes can lead to better management and improved quality of life for individuals at risk.

## Data Source and Description
The dataset used for this project is sourced from . It contains information on several health-related features, including glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, age, and more, for a sample of individuals. The target variable is binary, indicating whether the individual has diabetes (1) or not (0).

### Data Features
- Gender
- Blood Pressure
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Age
- Glucose Level

## Data Preprocessing
Before building the predictive model, it's crucial to preprocess the data. This may involve:
- Scaling or normalizing features
- Encoding categorical variables
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets

## Model Building
We will explore various machine learning algorithms to build a diabetes prediction model. Some of the algorithms we may consider include:
- XGBoost
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks

Also multimodel predictor with majority voting

We will train and evaluate multiple models to determine which one provides the best performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Model Evaluation
To assess the performance of the models, we will use the following evaluation metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve and AUC

We will also perform cross-validation to ensure that our model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data.

## Conclusion
In this project, i developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on their health-related features. We explored various algorithms, preprocessed the data, and evaluated model performance. The results will help in early detection and management of diabetes, contributing to better healthcare outcomes.
